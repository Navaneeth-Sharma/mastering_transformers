![alt text](https://tjmachinelearning.com/lectures/1718/guest/rnnadv/lstm/rnn_basic_cell.png)

## Advantages

- Variable length input
- Caring about word order
- Suitable for working in various modes (many to many, one to many)

## Disadvantages

- Long-term dependency problem
- Prone to exploding or vanishing gradient problems
- Hard to apply parallelizable training 
- The computation is slow as the sequence
