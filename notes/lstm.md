## Main Highlights

With this structure it is able to decide the following

- What kind of information we will store in the cell state
- Which information will be forgitten or deleted
  
The gate mechanism in the LSTM will allow architecture to skip some unrelated token to a certain extent. So it minimizes the issue of the vanishing gradient problem.
